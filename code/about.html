	<p>This website displays crime statistics of different cities within close proximity of a searched city.  The number of crimes reported is for the whole year of 2008.  This information appears on a map.  "Crime Index" is a number calculated with the following fomula:</p>
	<p>(total number of crimes) / (population) x 100</p>
	<p>Please do not rank, compare, or judge cities based solely on the data available on this website.  There are several reasons why, which you can read about <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2008/about/variables_affecting_crime.html">here</a>.</p>
	<p>All data (except crime index) comes from the FBI&#39;s "Table 8" for the year 2008, which is available on their <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2008/data/table_08.html">website</a> in various formats.</p>
	<p>In the table, the cities are ordered by proximity to the searched location.</p>
	<p>This website is a beta.</p>
	<p>What do the marker colors represent?</p>
	<ul>
		<li id="red">red: high crime index
		<li id="yellow">yellow: medium crime index
		<li id="green">green: low crime index
	</ul>
	<p>These categorizations are relative to the section of the map that is zoomed to the searched city and surroundings.  They are not absolute.</p>
